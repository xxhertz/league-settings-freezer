# What is this?

LeagueSettingsFreezer is a simple program which lingers in the tray of your taskbar. The purpose of the application is to persist League of Legends settings between accounts.

##### But can't I already do this by making PersistentSettings.json read-only?

This is precisely what this application does, but in the click of a button, and on the fly so that you don't have to go and open your League directory every time you want to change a setting.

#### How can I download and use it?

**Download:**
1. Head to the latest release on the right (or click [here](../../releases/latest) or use the links below)
2. Download [setup.exe](../../releases/download/release/setup.exe) or [LeagueSettingsFreezer.exe](../../releases/download/release/LeagueSettingsFreezerTray.exe) (you don't need both)

LeagueSettingsFreezer is a standalone application, and setup installs the application onto your Desktop and start menu, while also making sure that you have anything the program needs to run.

**Use it:**
1. Run the application
2. Check your tray, if the lock icon isn't there, [create an issue](../../issues) or [contact me on Discord](https://discord.gg/5vGaZBhde3)
3. Whenever you want to transfer settings, click the lock and make sure it's, well, locked.
4. Switch accounts
5. Profit.

#### Can I see it in action?

Of course you can. Click this to watch \\/
