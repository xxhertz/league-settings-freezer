# What is this?

LeagueSettingsFreezer is a simple program which lingers in the tray of your taskbar. The purpose of the application is to persist League of Legends settings between accounts.

##### But can't I already do this by making PersistentSettings.json read-only?

This is precisely what this application does, but in the click of a button, and on the fly so that you don't have to go and open your League directory every time you want to change a setting.

# Download:
1. Head to the latest release on the right (or click [here](../../releases/latest) or use the links below)
2. Download one of the following:
* [LSFInstaller.msi](../../releases/download/v1.1/LSFInstaller.msi) (desktop)
* [LSFInstaller-autostart.msi](../../releases/download/v1.1/LSFInstaller-autostart.msi) (above + runs when you start your computer)
* [LeagueSettingsFreezer.exe](../../releases/download/v1.1/LeagueSettingsFreezerTray.exe) (standalone)

LeagueSettingsFreezer.exe is a standalone application, LSFInstaller installs the application onto your Desktop and start menu, while also making sure that you have anything the program may need to function. The autostart variant will also cause the program to run when you start your computer.

### Use it automatically:
1. Run the application
2. Check your tray, if the lock icon isn't there, [create an issue](../../issues) or [contact me on Discord](https://discord.gg/5vGaZBhde3)
3. Whenever you enter the game, your settings will unlock for changing.

### Use it manually:
1. Run the application
2. Check your tray, if the lock icon isn't there, [create an issue](../../issues) or [contact me on Discord](https://discord.gg/5vGaZBhde3)

4. Whenever you want to transfer settings, click the lock and make sure it's, well, locked.
